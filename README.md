# Open Source RTL Design
This repository contains the usage of tools like iverilog, gtkwave and yosys for open-source RTL Design. The content is documentation of tasks carried out during VSD "RTL Design Using Verilog With SKY130 Technology".

## Open Source Tool Chain

Usually front-end RTL design is carried out using huge EDA Tools from different vendors. Even though many of the tools come with free limited versions its better to give a try for development using open-source tools. Below is the list of tools used by this repo.

### iverilog

iverilog is the tool used for compiling and simulation purpose. Simulation is the process of creating models that mimic the behavior of the device. Tool performs macro preprocessing, compilation, elaboration, optional optimizations and finally code generation. For more details about the tool refer the [wiki](https://iverilog.fandom.com/wiki/User_Guide).

* Use following command to install iverilog on Ubuntu machine

```
sudo apt install iverilog
```

### gtkwave

The simulator generates value change dump (.vcd) file this can be viewed as wave using gtkwave waveform viewer.

* Use following command to install gtkwave on Ubuntu machine

```
sudo apt install gtkwave
```

### yosys

yosys is used for synthesis. Synthesizer takes the design file and technology library file as input and produces netlist. Syntesis is the process in which the design is mapped to standard cells defined in the technology library. Here we are using SKY130 Technology library file. For further details about the tool refer the [documentation](http://www.clifford.at/yosys/documentation.html).
